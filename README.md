## The problem
You want to execute the Platzivideo project, but it requires to have a deployed API and a mongoDB instance developed from "curso de Backend con Node.js" and "Curso de Autenticaci√≥n con Passport.js", by this method we would need to use some sensitive credentials in order to show the tests.

## This solution

The actual proyect requires a deployed API and a mongoDB instance that provides the App a backend. For testing purposes the current repository has a docker-compose set-up to execute the whole App using 4 services (api, mongo, web, testing), by this way it does not require any deployed configuration or sensitive data, and it is pretty straight forward to execute.

## Installation

These images have all dependencies necessary to install and run Platzivideo with a testing module together. Just install `docker` & `docker-compose`, and enable the X11 Access Control to run the cypress GUI, then you will able to execute:

```docker-compose up```
